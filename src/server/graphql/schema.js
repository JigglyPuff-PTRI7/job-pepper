//graphQL schema needs to take a root query, which will serve as the baseline for other queries
//Root Query
//schema's root determines the shape of the queries and mutations accepted by the server

//ASSUMING WE ARE USING A RESTFUL API TO ASSIST IN GETTING DATA
//example query for user
// {
//     user(id: '1'){
//         name,
